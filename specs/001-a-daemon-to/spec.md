# Feature Specification: TRON Events Redis Stream Daemon

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-daemon-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a daemon to publish tron events as redis stream, max 7 days of events will be reteained at the stream. the daemon shall able to handle daemon interupted at any stage, when run again, the missing blocks shall be procesed, however, current ongoing blocks on tronblockchain are keep synching and publishing."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What is the expected maximum rate of TRON events per second that the system needs to handle during peak times? ‚Üí A: 500events per 3 seconds
- Q: For the retry mechanism mentioned in FR-006, what should be the maximum retry attempts for failed Redis and TRON blockchain connections? ‚Üí A: 5, 10, 30, 60, 180, 300,600,1800,3600
- Q: Should the daemon process prioritize processing new incoming blocks over catching up on missed historical blocks when both are occurring simultaneously? ‚Üí A: max 15 workers, one handles new blocks, one handles priority queue, at most 13 handle backlog with recent blocks prioritized
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of blocks that might need to be processed during a daemon restart after an extended downtime? ‚Üí A: up to 7 days's block, that's 201600 blocks
- Q: How should the system handle TRON blockchain reorganizations (blocks being replaced/removed) that might occur while the daemon is processing? ‚Üí A: that's impossible, all transaction events are immutable persisted forever

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator, I need a daemon that continuously monitors the TRON blockchain for new events and publishes them to a Redis stream, ensuring that events are retained for 7 days and that any interruptions in the daemon are handled gracefully with missed blocks being processed upon restart.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the daemon is running normally, **When** new TRON events occur on the blockchain, **Then** these events are published to the Redis stream in real-time
2. **Given** the daemon has been running for several days, **When** the daemon continues to operate, **Then** events older than 7 days are automatically removed from the Redis stream
3. **Given** the daemon is stopped unexpectedly, **When** the daemon is restarted, **Then** it processes any missed blocks since its last operation and continues normal operation
4. **Given** the daemon is running and actively processing new blocks, **When** new blocks are added to the TRON blockchain, **Then** the daemon continues to process both the missed historical blocks and new ongoing blocks simultaneously

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Redis connection fails temporarily?
- How does the system handle extremely large volumes of TRON events?
- What happens if the daemon is interrupted during the processing of a large range of missed blocks?
- TRON blockchain reorganizations do not occur as all transaction events are immutable and persisted forever

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST continuously monitor the TRON blockchain for new events and publish them to a Redis stream
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce a maximum retention period of 7 days for events in the Redis stream
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist the last processed block number to handle interruptions gracefully
- **FR-004**: System MUST process missed blocks when restarted after an interruption
- **FR-005**: System MUST continue processing new ongoing blocks while catching up on missed blocks
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle connection failures to Redis and TRON blockchain with retry backoff times of 5, 10, 30, 60, 180, 300, 600, 1800, and 3600 seconds
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all processing activities for monitoring and debugging purposes
- **FR-008**: System MUST demonstrate high-throughput processing of large backlogs and robustly handle interruptions and resumption of the process without data loss.
- **FR-009**: System MUST use up to 15 workers: one for new blocks (generated every 3 seconds), one for priority queue, and up to 13 for backlog queue with recent blocks (larger block numbers) prioritized over older blocks
- **FR-010**: System MUST be able to handle up to 201600 blocks as backlog during restart after extended downtime (up to 7 days worth of blocks)


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TRON Events**: Blockchain events extracted from TRON transactions and smart contracts, containing information such as addresses, values, and contract data
- **Redis Stream**: Ordered data structure that stores TRON events with timestamps, supporting automatic expiration of entries older than 7 days
- **Block Number**: Sequential identifier for TRON blockchain blocks, used to track processing progress and identify missed blocks
- **Event Data**: Structured representation of TRON blockchain events that is published to the Redis stream
